Hey guys! Here's my Chelsea FC Season Results – D3.js Visualization
📊 Assessment Response
This project is a response to the following task:

The data in this task is a .json file with the final season results of the English Premier League football team Chelsea FC for the past 10 years. The data includes the year, points accrued, wins, draws and losses, and other information about the team in each season (including the name of the coach and any trophies the team won).

It is your task to turn this information into a chart. It could be a simple bar or line chart, or anything more complicated that you wish to create.

✅ Solution
I created an interactive bar chart using D3.js that visualizes Chelsea FC’s wins and losses from 2010–2020, based on the provided JSON data.

🎯 Chart Type: Vertical grouped bar chart

🎨 Design Style: Simple, clean layout using pastel colors for accessibility and visual clarity

🧠 Data Insights: Each bar clearly shows performance trends across seasons

🖱️ Tech Used: HTML + D3.js v7

📁 Files
index.html – Contains the full D3 chart code and loads the dataset inline

data.json (optional) – Original dataset (inlined in current version for ease of use)
